# Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG's)

Welcome to the repository for the [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/).

In this hub you will find the draft specification for our [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) and any supplementary documentation, such as our [at-a-glance](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/glance.html) overview.

If you would like a quick introduction to both our group and our specification, you may find [the slides](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/TPAC_Slides.pdf) from the presentation we gave at TPAC 2023 useful.
