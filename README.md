# Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG's)

Welcome to the repository for the [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/).

In this hub, you will find the draft specification for our [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) and any supplementary documentation, such as our [at-a-glance](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/glance.html) overview. We also have a living implementation of the specification under active development called [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/).

If you would like a brief introduction to both our group and our specification, you may find [the slides](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/TPAC_Slides.pdf) from the presentation we gave at [TPAC 2023](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/breakouts/recording-32.html) useful.

If you would like to contribute feedback, create a [new issue](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues) with your recommendations. If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, email our open discussion group [public-sustyweb@w3.org](public-sustyweb@w3.org) ([comment archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sustyweb/)). We are currently not accepting Pull Requests (PR's) [at this time](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues/16), however, we will be publishing guidance shortly for individuals who wish to actively contribute to new features of the upcoming draft.
