# Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG's)

Welcome to the repository for the [Sustainable Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/).

In this hub, you will find the draft specification for our [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) and any supplementary documentation, including our [at-a-glance](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/glance.html) overview, our [quick reference](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/quickref.html), our [PDF checklist](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/checklist.pdf), and our [JSON API](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/guidelines.json). We also have a living implementation of the specification under active development called [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/).

If you would like a brief introduction to both our group and our specification, you may find [the slides](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/TPAC_Slides.pdf) from the presentation we gave at [TPAC 2023](https://www.w3.org/2023/09/breakouts/recording-32.html) useful. To learn more about our group, its goals, and our progress, check out our [wiki](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/wiki/Main_Page), and [frequently asked questions](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions) page.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute feedback, the preferred method is to create a [new issue](https://github.com/w3c/sustyweb/issues) with your comments. You could provide comments on technical errors (bugs) you have uncovered, new guidelines or success criteria you believe should be added, questions you have about existing or future content, or an idea for a direction or feature we could utilize.

Please check that your question hasn't already been posted first, and provide as much detail as possible (if you have a solution or content to add, it would be very helpful). We're all volunteers so please keep this in mind and try to be civil when commenting about our work.

We are now allowing pull requests (PR's) on our repository, however, due to the W3C formatting specification we use (ReSpec), our need to heavily moderate contributions for content quality, and our internal review processes (this is a specification after all), any requests will have their changes vetted against a local copy until approved and then will be merged into the main document at the next release schedule.

If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, email our open discussion group [public-sustyweb@w3.org](public-sustyweb@w3.org) ([comment archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sustyweb/)).

All contributors will receive credit (in the specification and our GitHub release notes) if their feedback and ideas make it into the document.

## JSON API

We have a [JSON API](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/guidelines.json) which is kept in sync with the changes occurring within our specification.

This document is reachable via GitHub pages and can be queried using JavaScript to embed our data within your client of choice.

The structure of the API is identical to that of the specification in its numbering scheme:

`category[1][0].guideline = "Undertake Systemic Impacts Mapping"`
